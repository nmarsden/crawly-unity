# Crawly

_A 'snake' like game with a twist._

## Instructions

* Collect Green cubes to grow.
* Collect Blue tall & thin cuboid to active your shields.
* Avoid collecting Red short & wide cuboid which cause you to shrink unless your shields are active.
* Avoid bumping into walls and yourself.
* Complete a level by making all the floor tiles green.
* A white floor tile becomes green and remains green for a few seconds once touched.
* A grey floor tile only remains green while being touched.

## Features

* 10 levels of increasing difficulty
* music/FX
* view toggle

## Potential features (maybe?)

* Larger cubes have more effect.  Eg. large green cube => +2 parts; large red cube => -2parts
* Show animation when a level is complete
* Start each level with more body parts
* Mystery (Rainbow) cubes cause unexpected changes (eg. change turning behaviour, shrink, grow, etc.)
* Instructions Screen - describing how the game works
* Difficulty Setting - Easy/Medium/Hard - increase difficulty by having more frequent red cubes, less green cubes, etc..
* Improve look by using custom shaders.
* Ramps for multi-tier arenas
* Camera shake when shrinking & exploding
* Particle effect when picking up
* Trail when pickups falling
* Fix UI appearing behind player in FPV, by using a seperate camera for UI with a higher depth value (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8k88iZWcB8)
